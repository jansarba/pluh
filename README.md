# pluh

An audiovisual time killer helping me with musician's block. Kind of like a fidget toy, it also makes for some nice non-intrusive ambient for studying.

Live on [https://jansarba.github.io/pluh/](https://jansarba.github.io/pluh/)

Uses [Tone.js](https://tonejs.github.io/) for sound generation and audio FX. FFT and visuals are implemented manually.
